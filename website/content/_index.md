# What is BuhoCMS?

{{< warning title="⚠️ Alpha warning" content="BuhoCMS is currently in Alpha. While most things should work as expected, bugs are likely to exist. It is a good idea to backup your website folders just in case. Also, remember that many more features are planned! ✨" >}}

BuhoCMS is a **local Content Management System** for **static site generators** ([list of supported SSGs](#features)).

See BuhoCMS as a **GUI for static site generators**. Easily create or open a website, choose your theme and add your first posts. With BuhoCMS, adding and editing content is as easy as a few clicks. No more terminal commands, folder hunting or manual Front matter edits 🥳

### Who is BuhoCMS for?

BuhoCMS is made for... you 😃

...that is, everyone using a static site generator who wants an easy to use, graphical way to edit content, so that you can make the best use out of the power of a static site generator: *Creating and editing content.*

BuhoCMS is ideal for you if you land in at least one of the following categories:

- You **already have a static site** from a supported SSG and want to easily edit your content from now on
- You want to **create a static site from zero** with a graphical user interface
- You are a **beginner** looking for a simple way to begin your journey in using static site generators
